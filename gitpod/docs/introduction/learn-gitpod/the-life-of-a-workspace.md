# The life of a workspace

Gitpod makes creating fresh workspaces as easy as clicking a [button on a repository page](/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).
Gitpod's continuous dev environments encourages you to create fresh workspaces rather than restarting older ones.
This ensures that you are starting from a clean slate with proper configuration.

## Workspace loading phases (New)

A workspace creation is a linear process (from a high-level perspective) except for a few things, which we will see later.

<!--

- The workspace resources (e.g. CPU and RAM) are allocated based on your configured [Workspace class](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-classes#workspace-classes).

- The container image will be downloaded each time for your workspace.

- Your workspace may be created from any repository context (i.e. issue, pull-request, branch and so on)

- Task terminal outputs are saved inside `/workspace/.gitpod` directory if you wish to inspect them externally.
-
-->

### 1: Establishing Workspace Context

All workspaces start with from a single Git "context", e.g. [GitHub](/docs/configure/authentication/github), [GitLab](/docs/configure/authentication/gitlab), [Bitbucket](/docs/configure/authentication/bitbucket).

If there is already a running workspace from the same git context, you will be prompted to open the running workspace or to start a new one.

![Workspace Already Exist](/images/workspace-life/workspace-already-exist.png)

See [Context URLs](/docs/introduction/learn-gitpod/context-url) for more.

### 2: Establish Workspace Image

Gitpod checks for the existence of a [Workspace Image](/docs/configure/workspaces/workspace-image) via the [`image`](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#image) property in a committed `.gitpod.yml`, which is taken from the Git context of the workspace.

If no `image` property is supplied, workspaces default to the [**workspace-full**](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitpod/workspace-full) image.

<!-- TODO: Look into OCI compatibility https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec -->

> **Note:** Currently, only Docker images are supported with Gitpod.

<!-- TODO: We need to mention what even is an "image" -->
<!-- TODO: We could give one or two examples of tools installed in the workspace-full image -->
<!-- TODO: We don't have a good landing page for Workspace Full documentation -->

See [Workspace Images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images) for more.

### 3: Build Workspace Image

If your Workspace Image cache isn't available, the image will be built.

### 4: Provision Workspace

Once the Git context is established, and the Workspace Image is built, a workspace is provisioned.

### 5: Clone Git repo(s)

The specified Git context is cloned into the provisioned workspace.

- `git` submodules are also initialized on workspace
- To clone more than one repo, use the [multi-repo](/docs/configure/workspaces/multi-repo) feature

<!-- - `/workspace/.gitpod/ready` file is created after cloning is completed -->

### 4: Install Dotfiles

[Dotfiles](/docs/configure/user-settings/dotfiles) allows you to customize workspaces according to your personal needs.

Dotfiles can be configured by linking to a public repository in [preferences](https://gitpod.io/preferences)

<!-- TODO: Should we link to /docs/configure/user-settings rather than preferences directly? -->

If configured:

- Dotfiles repository cloned to `~/.dotfiles` directory
- The installation script is executed (e.g. `install.sh`)
- Dotfiles installation is limited to 2 minutes

<!-- TODO: Any further progress will be halted until your dotfiles is fully installed. -->
<!-- TODO: Figure out "Gitpod will automatically symlink all files recursively from `~/.dotfiles` to `~`, _if you do not have an installation script_." -->
<!-- TODO: More "it will receive a `SIGKILL` error, if it exceeds the limit." to Dotfiles page -->
<!-- TODO: Logs file can be found at `~/.dotfiles.log` -->

### 5: Execute "Before" Task

<!-- TODO: Should this be "Workspace Tasks"? -->

[Workspace Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) are setup processes for a [Project](/docs/configure/projects) executed on every workspace start.

<!-- TODO: Project or repository? -->

- (optional) `before` task run to install any global dependencies

<!-- TODO: Where should we introduce `init` -->
<!-- TODO: Is this with Prebuilds or not? -->
<!-- TODO: "Task terminal outputs are saved inside `/workspace/.gitpod` directory if you wish to inspect them externally." -->

See [Gitpod prebuilds](/docs/configure/projects/prebuilds) for more.

### 6: Initialize IDE

Your chosen IDE or editor is started.

- (optional) [VSCode](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/vscode-extensions#installing-an-extension) extensions installed.
- (optional) [JetBrains](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/intellij#preconfigure-for-repository) plugins installed.
- (optional) VS Code [Settings Sync](/docs/references/ides-and-editors/settings-sync) installed e.g. fonts and themes

<!-- TODO: Should we add optional flag to the section -->

This step is done in the background (i.e. non-blocking) so your IDE can start ahead of time.

**Your selected IDE is launched** ðŸŽ‰

### 7: Execute "Command" Task

Once the IDE is started, any `command` tasks are now executed.

See [Workspace Tasks](/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks) for more.

### 8: Stop Workspace

<!-- TODO: Find correct Position for screenshot  -->

![Stop workspace from dashboard](/images/workspace-life/stop-workspace.png)

Your workspace may stop for one of these reasons:

- User issuing a command to stop the workspace (for example executing `gp stop`)
- User inactivity triggering a [Workspace Timeout](#timeouts)
- User is suspected of abusing Gitpod's [Terms of Service](/terms).

So what happens to your workspace files? The following applies:

- [All files inside `/workspace` directory is persisted.](#changes-are-saved)
- [Garbase collection](#garbage-collection)

### 8: Restart Workspace

## Timeouts

Any running workspace will automatically stop after some time of inactivity. Normally, this timeout is 30 minutes but is extended to **60 minutes if you have an _Unleashed_ plan**.
Furthermore, _Unleashed_ users can manually boost the timeout of a workspace to 180 minutes. This comes in handy, e.g. in case you want to go out for a longer lunch or meeting and don't like restarting your workspace when coming back.

To do that, open the editor's Command Palette (<Keybind>CtrlCmd + Shift + P</Keybind>) and search for "Gitpod: Extend Workspace Timeout".

**Note**: If you do not have an _Unleashed_ plan, this command is not available.

The timeout will always be reset to the full 30 minutes (or other applicable timeout depending on your subscription) by any activity&thinsp;â€”&thinsp;mouse move or keystroke&thinsp;â€”&thinsp;in the editor.
If the editor is still open but the corresponding workspace has stopped, a dialog will pop up that lets you start the workspace
again. Alternatively, you can just reload the browser or go to your [Workspaces Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) and restart the workspace.

For convenience, closing the browser window/tab containing the workspace reduces the timeout to 3 minutes.

### What happens if my workspace times out?

Not to worry, your changes are safe. You can navigate back to [Workspaces Dashboard](https://gitpod.io/workspaces), look for your stopped workspace and start it again to continue working.

### I want my team / client to review my work

If you want to send a preview URL to someone so they can review your work, you may do that as long as your workspace doesn't time out. Make sure you set your application's port's `visibility` to `public` ([docs](/docs/references/gitpod-yml#portsnvisibility)).

In cases where you don't know how long it will take until someone looks at your preview, it is best to use pull request preview deployments provided by your hosting provider.

## Garbage collection

Unused or inactive workspaces are automatically deleted after 14 days. A message is also displayed at the bottom of the [workspaces list](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) within the `Inactive Workspaces` panel in your dashboard. Restarting a workspace resets the day counter for that particular workspace.

To prevent a workspace from being deleted, you can pin it in your [list of workspaces](https://gitpod.io/workspaces). Pinned workspaces are kept forever.

## Changes are saved

Gitpod backs up the state of the `/workspace/` directory between workspace starts, so that
you can revisit them later. _Attention: Files in other paths will not be saved!_
