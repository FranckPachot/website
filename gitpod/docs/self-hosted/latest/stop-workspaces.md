# Stop Workspaces

Sometimes it becomes necessary to stop Gitpod workspaces (in a `<namespace>`). Usually this needs to be done when updating Gitpod. Please see the [update guide](./updating) for more information. 

This can be done with `kubectl`, and when done so, the IDE is closed, data in `/workspace` is backed up, and then the pod finally terminates.

## A single workspace

```shell
$ kubectl delete pods <workspace-or-headless-pod-name> -n <namespace>
```

## All workspaces

> **Caution**: This will delete all actively running workspaces.

Can be done prior to outage windows, or for troubleshooting.

```shell
$ kubectl delete pods -l component=workspace -n <namespace>
```
