    Twenty-five years ago software engineers started the journey to continuous
    integration; centralised and automated it made all of us more efficient.
    <br /><br />
    Fifteen years later we started the journey to continuous deployment which gave
    teams agency, the power to experiment and learn quickly.
    <br /><br />
    Today we find ourselves on another transformational journey towards “continuous
    development”; from static and brittle development environments to consistently
    reproducible, instant, ephemeral and disposable Cloud Development Environments.
