### Feature highlights

- You can now create the infrastructure you need to run Gitpod using terraform. Please refer to the [single cluster reference architecture](../docs/self-hosted/latest/reference-architecture/single-cluster-ref-arch) for links and details. This will replace the guides used previously. More details on this will be communicated very shortly.

### Breaking changes

- [11954](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/11954): remove custom labels from the pod selector labels. This removes this [limitation](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/self-hosted/latest/advanced/customization#limitations) so this is a long-term improvement. The impact of this should be handled transparently for you by the KOTS installer.
- [12336](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/pull/12336): Removal of PodSecurityPolicies. These were deprecated from Kubernetes 1.21 and removed from 1.25. This allows Gitpod to run on Kubernetes 1.25+, which is scheduled for imminent release. If you have PodSecurityPolicies enabled in your cluster, we suggest you enable them if possible.

Please refer to the [2022.08 upgrade guide](../docs/self-hosted/latest/upgrade-guides#202208) in the documentation for details.

### Fixes and improvements
