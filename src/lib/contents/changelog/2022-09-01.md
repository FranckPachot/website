## JetBrains

## JetBrains now respects SDK versions defined in `.idea/misc.xml`

Previously, when opening a Java Workspace with JetBrains, the Gitpod IDE would select the latest SDK version as the default. This was problematic when we recently updated the Gitpod `workspace-full` image, which many users are reliant upon, to include both Java 11 and 17. When having multiple SDK versions, JetBrains would default to using the latest SDK version, which in the case of the `workspace-full` image was 17. However, now Gitpod looks first at the `.idea/misc.xml`. If there is no SDK version set in `.idea/misc.xml`, the IDE will fall back to the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

## View Resource Consumption in JetBrains Backend Control Center

When using a Gitpod workspace you might experience performance issues caused by an application using more resources than expected, or due to resource consumption in adjacent containers on the node. Whatever the reason, you may want to investigate what's going on within your workspace.

We've now extended the JetBrains [Backend Control Center](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/work-inside-remote-project.html#control_center) with two additional bits of information about your workspace: `Workspace CPU` and `Workspace Memory`. The additional performance information shown in the control center is for the node that your workspace is running on, and not the workspace itself. This information is also the same that can be found from running the command `gp top` in your workspace.

## VS Code Desktop

### VS Code Desktop reduced popups when opening

Many users love Gitpod for how simple it can make working with your projects. However, for VS Code Desktop there were some cases where you needed to respond to specific popups when opening your workspace, for instance accepting the SSH fingerprint of the workspace, or accepting the browser redirect when opening a workspace.

The number of prompts you are now shown when opening VS Code Desktop is reduced.

You should see one browser redirect prompt (one for [VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode) and one for [JetBrains Gateway](/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway)), marking "always allow" will suppress all future prompts. SSH fingerprints are also now automatically added to your `known_hosts` if you're using [SSH Gateway approach to opening VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode#connecting-to-vs-code-desktop-ssh).

For more information, check out our dedicated documentation for [optimising VS Code Desktop](/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode#optimizing-vs-code-desktop).

### All VS Code Desktop users on SaaS are now using SSH Gateway! ðŸŽ‰

We have now completed a migration of all VS Code Desktop users on SaaS to our new SSH Gateway approach. This change brings improved stability, smoother restarting of workspaces, and more.

To get setup, we recommend you [upload an SSH key to Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/ssh#upload-an-ssh-key-to-gitpod). For full details on why we made this change to our SSH approach for VS Code Desktop, please check out our blog post [VS Code Desktop and SSH explained](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-desktop-ssh-updates).

If you cannot use the new approach for any reason, please reach out via the GitHub issue #[7452](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues/7452).

## `gp` updates

Over the last few months we've been making lots of updates to `gp`. Why? Because the `gp` command-line-interface is bundled inside of all Gitpod workspaces, so `gp` can act as a common way to run workspace actions regardless of what editor or IDE users are using Gitpod with, whether that's JetBrains, VS Code or directly via SSH.

Let's say that you're documenting your Gitpod setup, rather than detailing how to take certain actions directly within an IDE or editor, you can easily share commands. Also, by providing functionality in `gp` we're ensuring that behaviours are consistent across all the Gitpod code editing experiences.

### `gp tasks list` shows your current tasks (as defined in the `.gitpod.yml`)

The `gp tasks list` command allows you to list any running commands that are defined in your `.gitpod.yml`. If you want, you can even attach to a given task using `gp tasks attach` which brings that current task into the foreground of your terminal. However, since there are situations where it might not be as easy to figure out which terminal you're currently viewing, that's why we now highlight your current task to make life a little easier for you

### `gp tasks stop` stops running tasks that (as defined in the `.gitpod.yml`)

You can now run `gp tasks stop` to stop running tasks that have been defined in your `.gitpod.yml`. You can either stop a single task with `gp tasks stop <id`, or terminate all tasks by running `gp tasks stop --all`.

See the `gp` [Command Line Interface](/docs/command-line-interface#stop-1) documentation for more.
