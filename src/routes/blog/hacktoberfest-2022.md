Hello, fellow coder!üëã

Here at Gitpod... we love [Open Source](https://www.gitpod.io/for/opensource) and [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com)!

## Contribute to Open Source in Gitpod

Within Gitpod, you can contribute to all of your favorite Open Source repos:

- For free (for 50 hours a month)
- Without a high-spec laptop (you can code in Gitpod... even from your mobile or tablet)
- Worrying about configuring your environment (aka "breaking your machine"!)

Yes... even coding in a Tesla üòé

## Contribute to Gitpod in Gitpod

Not only can you contribute to Open Source in Gitpod

But you can even **contribute _to Gitpod (our codebase) while working in Gitpod_**.

Sounds like magic? üßô‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well, that's because it kinda is!

Let us show you how Gitpod works and how you can get started contributing to Hacktoberfest in Gitpod!

## Wait, what is Gitpod?

If you're new to Gitpod, let us get you quickly up to speed! Gitpod allows you to spin up developer environments for every task. In more simple terms, you're coding in the cloud, and not on your own machine. You can use [VS Code in your browser](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode-browser), [VS Code on Desktop](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode), or a [JetBrains IDE](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/jetbrains-gateway) like [IntelliJ IDEA(https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/intellij).

All you have to do is prefix a repository url with: `gitpod.io/#`

For example, click here to start the Node project in a Gitpod workspace:

[https://github.com/nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

### Components

We build Gitpod "out in the open", which means our [entire codebase](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod), [every one of our issues](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/issues) and even our [roadmap](https://gitpod.io/roadmap) are all entirely open! Gitpod is one of the many friendly Open Source communities you can join to get your first taste of contribution.

Good places to start:

- [`gp`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/tree/main/components/gitpod-cli)
- [`backend plugin`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod/tree/main/components/ide/jetbrains/backend-plugin)
- [`documentation`](https://github.com/gitpod-io/website)
